# Design:
This assignment asked us to write a basic "Hello world" program, as well as a program that defined and printed several variables of different data types. The main purpose of this assignment was to learn how to compile and run C code, and to understand the different restraints and uses of C's many data types.

# Testing:
The "Hello world" program was written in class with the teacher and did not require any testing beyond learning how to use gcc. The data types program worked as expected, with one exception: when the Float data type was set to 20.21, the program printed the value as 20.209999. This was found to be a data representation error, and as of now could only be fixed by using a different number.

# Reflection:
This was my first time ever coding in C. However, I was able to follow along with very few problems, and asked questions when necessary. The only test that initially failed was the float printing test; since this was a data representation error, it actually worked out to be more a problem with C than with my code.

The details that I and probably many others missed during this assignment were small things such as syntax (semicolons everywhere!) and defining the data type of a variable before assigning it a value. The biggest aid in this assignment was the teacher's advice; the next was online resources for C data types. This project set the foundations for everything we will do in C in the future.
